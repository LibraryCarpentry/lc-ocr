## Introduction

Welcome to this hands-on lesson to learn some text and data mining skills. We will first run through some of the basics that you will need when exploring and analysing text.

## What is Text Mining?

Text mining, or text analysis, is a method using natural language processing (NLP) and computer science to transform unstructured data or text from documents, websites or databases into a more manageable structured corpus suitable for using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The purpose is to gain a deeper understanding and discover patterns in the content being analysed.
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) text mining involves discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources. 
Text mining tasks include a broad range of methods, from text categorization, text clustering, concept extraction and even production of granular taxonomies or document summarization.

## Terminology

To start with here is a bit of basic terminology that will be used in this lesson:

__Token:__ a single word, letter, number or punctuation mark.

__String:__ a group of characters comprised of words, letters, numbers, punctuation.

__Integer:__ a positive or negative whole number without a decimal point.

__Stop words:__ generally the most common words in a language (e.g. "the", "of", "and" etc.) which are sometimes filtered out during text analysis in order to focus on the vocabulary that conveys more of the content of a piece of text.

__Document:__ a single file containing some text.

__Corpus:__ a collection of documents.
